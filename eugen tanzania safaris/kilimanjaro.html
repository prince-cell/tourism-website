                            Kilimanjaro. This could partly be as a
                            result of the fact that the Marangu is the least expensive route but more so perhaps the
                            fact that it is
                            possible to do the Marangu route in 5 day thereby getting to the summit one day earlier
                            compared to the
                            Machame route This is not always the best way due to a shorter acclimatization period.
                            The 5 day Kilimanjaro Climb Marangu route does however offer you the option of spending an
                            extra
                            acclimatization day on the mountain. This extends the route into a 6days climbing mount

                                with your picnic lunch. From Mandara hut the trail passes through a short stretch of
                                forest, and then heads around the base of the Maundi Crater where you will leave the
                                forest and enter the moorland.</li>
                            <li>We recommend you take a short detour up to the rim of the Maundi Crater – from here you
                                see the impressive Kibo Crater, and on a clear day you will also be able to see the
                                glaciers of Kibo. This is a great photographic opportunity. In the moorlands you will
                                also encounter some of Kilimanjaro most spectacular and strange plants in the open
                                moorland – with giant lobelia and groundsel growing to heights of 3 and 5 metres
                                respectively! Later in the afternoon you reach Horombo Hut to stay for hot dinner and an
                                overnight. Your hut will be comfortable enough to ensure a good nights rest.
                                Temperatures during the night will be around freezing point.</li>

                            <li>The climb is becoming more difficult as the oxygen at these altitudes begins to thin out
                                considerably. To begin today you can take one of the two trails to the “Saddle”, located
                                between the peaks of Mawenzi and Kibo. Stick to the lower route, which is much easier
                                and has the added benefit of taking you past the last watering point. You should stock
                                up with all the water you will need – the next watering point will be at Horombo hut
                                when you return there on your descent the night after next. Once again remember to take
                                it slowly and drink enough water. It will take from 5 to 7 hours to reach Kibo Hut where
                                you will rest and have dinner. This is a barren area of extreme conditions, with
                                temperatures at night sometimes dropping to below freezing point and daytime
                                temperatures being relatively high. Kibo is a large stone house that can comfortably
                                sleep 60 hikers in bunk beds – remember there is no water supply at this hut. There are

                                otherwise it will freeze later. Make sure you are in bed by 7:00 pm – you will need all

                                head off into the cold night up a rocky path towards to the Hans Meyer Cave at 5150
                                meters – you may take a short rest here before continuing your ascent up to Gillman’s
                                point at 5680 metres. Probably the most demanding section of the entire route as it is
                                very steep and stony – go slowly and carefully here. From Gillman’s Point, you will more
                                than likely be walking through snow for the next 2 hours, when you will finally reach
                                the summit of Uhuru Peak at 5895 metres.</li>

                                started again. So spend a little time to enjoy the fact that you have conquered
                                Kilimanjaro, get the camera out and take some pictures, then it will be best that you
                                get moving again – it's a long way down! The first part of your descent to Kibo hut will
                                take almost another 3 hours. After a short rest you which will be accompanied with heavy
                                breakfast, you will begin the next part of your descent – it will take another 3 hours
                                of hiking to get to Horombo hut. Arriving Horombo hut at afternoon for hot hut lunch and
                                rest as well as dinner and spend overnight there. You will no doubt have a good sleep,

                            <p class="px-5">Below is the day by day itinerary for the 6 day Machame climb on Mount
                                Kilimanjaro.
                                For those who only have six days to climb Kilimanjaro, the Machame route is the best
                                choice because of its acclimatization profile. Compared to other six day routes, the
                                Machame route exposes the climber to higher elevations quicker (day three) which
                                kickstarts the body’s adaptation to altitude. However, this route requires that a person
                                be in good shape to be able to tackle the challenging elevation gains and losses.
                                The six day Machame variation is a difficult route. In particular, day four combined
                                with day five makes for a very hard schedule. Day four is a full day of hiking from
                                Barranco to Barafu. Then after dinner and a partial night’s sleep, the very long and
                                strenuous summit day begins around midnight. The 6 day Machame route requires 19-24
                                hours of demanding walking, at extremely high elevation, with only 4-6 hours of sleep.

                                <li>The drive from Moshi to the Mount Kilimanjaro National Park Gate takes about 50
                                    minutes. The journey passes through the village of Machame which is located on the
                                    lower slopes of the mountain.</li>
                                <li>We now leave the park gate and walk through the rain forest on a winding trail up a
                                    ridge. Lower down, the trail can be muddy and slippery. Gaiters and trekking poles
                                    are a good idea here. We continue a short distance until we reach the Machame Camp.

                                    towards the Lava Tower, called the “Shark’s Tooth.” Shortly after the tower, we come
                                    to the second junction which brings us up to the Arrow Glacier at an altitude of
                                    16,000ft. We now continue down to the Barranco Hut at an altitude of 13,000ft. Here
                                    we rest, enjoy dinner, and overnight. Although you end the day at the same elevation
                                    as when you started, this day is very important for acclimatization and will help

                                <li>After breakfast, we leave Barranco and continue on a steep ridge passing the
                                    Barranco Wall, to the Karanga Valley campsite. Then, we leave Karanga and hit the
                                    junction which connects with the Mweka Trail. We continue up to the Barafu Hut. At
                                    this point, you have completed the South Circuit, which offers views of the summit
                                    from many different angles. Here we make camp, rest, enjoy dinner, and prepare for
                                    the summit day. The two peaks of Mawenzi and Kibo are to be seen from this position.

                                <li>Very early in the morning (midnight to 2am), we continue our way to the summit
                                    between the Rebmann and Ratzel glaciers. You head in a northwesterly direction and
                                    ascend through heavy scree towards Stella Point on the crater rim. This is the most
                                    mentally and physically challenging portion of the trek.</li>
                                <li>At Stella Point (18,600 ft), you will stop for a short rest and will be rewarded
                                    with the most magnificent sunrise you are ever likely to see (weather permitting).
                                    From Stella Point, you may encounter snow all they way on your 1-hour ascent to the
                                    summit. At Uhuru Peak, you have reached the highest point on Mount Kilimanjaro and
                                    the continent of Africa. Faster hikers will see the sunrise from the summit.</li>
                                <li>From the summit, we now make our descent continuing straight down to the Mweka Hut
                                    camp site, stopping at Barafu for lunch. You will want gaiters and trekking poles
                                    for the loose gravel going down. Mweka Camp is situated in the upper forest and mist
                                    or rain can be expected in the late afternoon. Later in the evening, we enjoy our
                                    last dinner on the mountain and a well-earned sleep.</li>

                                    trekking poles will help. Shorts and t-shirts will probably be plenty to wear (keep
                                    rain gear and warmer clothing handy).
                                    From the gate, you continue another hour to Mweka Village. A vehicle will meet you
                                    at Mweka village to drive you back to hotel in Moshi.
